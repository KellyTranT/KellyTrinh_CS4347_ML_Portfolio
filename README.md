# KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio
This is my portfolio for CS 4347 - Machine Learning at UTD with Dr. Karen Mazidi!

Name: Kelly Trinh --
Course: CS 4375.004

## Summary from this Course
I believe that this course is one that I learned from the most from my college education. I have not only developed a great amount of technical skills through learning both Python and R, but I have garnered a great interest for Machine Learning itself. I believe that this course has only scratched the surface for the skills that I can develop and the knowledge that I could gain from learning more about this field. I've also decided to take another ML related course next year, which is Human Language Technologies, and I think that my knowledge from this class will greatly assist me. I have realized that Machine Learning is one of the most important aspects for the future of technology because it is helping us develop knowledge of understanding data. For future personal projects, I want to go through more different types of datasets and attempt to create ML models with them that I've never tried before, such as using a NLP model for understanding language data. In order to keep up with how rapidly the ML field is changing, I plan on continuing to try new ML models on different types of data, and I plan on reading more about how different types of models are being applied to data. I would love to be able to develop a career in ML as well so that I can further develop my skils and apply them to a real-life situation, and I hope that my education of ML does not end here!

## Skills Learned Throughout the Course
I have strengthened and gained a significant amount of technical and soft skills through the completion of this course. Please read about these skills [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Skills%20from%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)!

## Portfolio Setup & Overview of Machine Learning
You can read my personal summary and reflection of Machine Learning [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## C++ Data Exploration
You can see the data exploration code for this assignment [here](/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration/CPP_Data_Exploration_main.cpp), and you can read
my reflection/document on this assignment [here](/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration_Reflection.pdf).

## Linear Models
There are two parts of this assignment. The data is included in the GitHub folder as a csv file. You can access the Regression part of the assignment [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) and the Classification part [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf).

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch
I re-created Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms in C++. You can see the code for the logistic regression [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/logisticRegression.cpp), the code for Naive Bayes [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/naiveBayes.cpp), and the overview document [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/Overview_Document_C%2B%2B_Algorithms.pdf).

## Similarity and Ensemble
This was a project that I worked on in a group of 5. For my part, I performed different clustering methods on a data set, specifically KMeans, Hierarchical, and Model-based clustering. You can see my part [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Similarity%20and%20Ensemble/Notebook-3-Clustering.pdf), and the rest of the project completed by my team members in the folder [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Similarity%20and%20Ensemble).

## ML with sklearn
This project is my first Python ML project, where I performed different algorithms as well as trained two neural networks with a dataset. You can see the PDF of my project [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20with%20sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf).

## Image Classification
In this project, I performed classification on a data set of images using the Keras and Tensorflow libraries in Python. I used deep learning with neural networks. You can see the models that I created for the images [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Image%20Classification/image_classification.pdf).
