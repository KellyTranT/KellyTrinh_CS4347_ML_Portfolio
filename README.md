# KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio
This is my portfolio for CS 4347 - Machine Learning at UTD with Dr. Karen Mazidi!

Name: Kelly Trinh --
Course: CS 4375.004

# Skills Learned Throughout the Course
I have strengthened and gained a significant amount of technical and soft skills through the completion of this course. Please read about these skills [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Skills%20from%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)!

# Portfolio Setup & Overview of Machine Learning
You can read my personal summary and reflection of Machine Learning [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf).

# C++ Data Exploration
You can see the data exploration code for this assignment [here](/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration/CPP_Data_Exploration_main.cpp), and you can read
my reflection/document on this assignment [here](/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration/C%2B%2B_Data_Exploration_Reflection.pdf).

# Linear Models
There are two parts of this assignment. The data is included in the GitHub folder as a csv file. You can access the Regression part of the assignment [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) and the Classification part [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf).

# C++ Algorithms from Scratch
I re-created Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms in C++. You can see the code for the logistic regression [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/logisticRegression.cpp), the code for Naive Bayes [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/naiveBayes.cpp), and the overview document [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/C%2B%2B_Algorithms_From_Scratch/Overview_Document_C%2B%2B_Algorithms.pdf).

# Similarity and Ensemble
This was a project that I worked on in a group of 5. For my part, I performed different clustering methods on a data set, specifically KMeans, Hierarchical, and Model-based clustering. You can see my part [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Similarity%20and%20Ensemble/Notebook-3-Clustering.pdf), and the rest of the project completed by my team members in the folder [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Similarity%20and%20Ensemble).

# ML with sklearn
This project is my first Python ML project, where I performed different algorithms as well as trained two neural networks with a dataset. You can see the PDF of my project [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/ML%20with%20sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf).

# Image Classification
In this project, I performed classification on a data set of images using the Keras and Tensorflow libraries in Python. I used deep learning with neural networks. You can see the models that I created for the images [here](https://github.com/KellyTranT/KellyTrinh_CS4375_ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Image%20Classification/image_classification.pdf).
